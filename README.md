## Description

Do you ever travel and visit cool places but have no way to track the awesome places you would like to revisit? Gypsy is an app that allows any user to create a profile, drop markers on locations in Austin, Dallas, or Houston, allowing you, the traveler to save a location with a the ability to write a description.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to save the places I visit
SO THAT I can keep track of the places I enjoy most while exploring a city
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an option to select between: Austin, Dallas or Houston
WHEN I double click the map
THEN a pushpin is dropped/displays on the map
WHEN the pushpin is dropped the coordinates are saved
THEN I am able to enter a name and description
WHEN I log back it at another time, my saved locations, name and description will be there
```
